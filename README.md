project 1 : Dog breed prediction (Flask app)

steps:
1) loading dataset from kaggle
2) load labels csv fro labels that contain image and breed
3) checking breed count
4) one hot encoding on labels data prediction coloumn
5) load the image,convert them into array and normalize them
6) check the shape and size of the x and y data
7)building network architecture
8) split data and fit into the model and create an accuracy plot
9) evaluate model for accuracy score
10) using model for prediction
